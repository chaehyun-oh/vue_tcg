# S.19 The Composition API - Replacing the Options API

### What is the “Composition API”

-   Thus far, we used to the Options API for building Vue apps / components.
-   But you might face two main limitaions / issues when building bigger Vue apps.
-   Code that belongs together logically is split up across multiple options (data, methods, computed)
-   Re-using logic across components can be tricky or cumbersome
