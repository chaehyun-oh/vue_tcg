# S.2 Basics & Core Concepts - DOM Interaction with Vue

## Introducing Computed Properties

: Computed Properties are essentially like methods with one important difference view will be aware of their dependencies and only reexecute them if one of the dependencies changed.

```jsx
computed: {
    fullname() {
      if (this.name === '') {
        return '';
      }
      return this.name + ' ' + 'Last name';
    }
  },
```

## Working with Watchers

: Watchers are powerful, if you have a different kind of intent in mind. If you wanna run some code, which may be, but not necessarily also updates some data property in reaction to a property changing. If you wanna do that execute code, because something changed, then watchers can be helpful. If you just want to calculate some output value dynamically, computed properties are your friend.

```jsx
watch: {
    counter(value) {
      if (value > 50) {
        this.counter = 0;
      }
    }
```

## Methods vs Computed Properties vs Watchers

-   Methods
    -   Use with event binding OR data binding
    -   Data binding : Method is executed for every “rerender” cycle of the component
    -   Use for events or data that really needs to be re-evaluated all the time
-   Computed
    -   Use with data binding
    -   Computed properties are only re-evaluated if one of their “used values” changed
    -   Use for data that depends on other data
-   Watch
    -   Not used directly in template
    -   Allows you to run any code in reaction to some changed data (e.g. send Http request etc)
    -   Use for any non-data update you want to make
