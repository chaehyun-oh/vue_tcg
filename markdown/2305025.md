# S.7 Moving to a Better Development Setup & Workflow with the Vue CLI

## Why We Need A Development Server

-   “Double-clicking” index.html doesn’t run the app under realistic circumstances
    -   We use the file:// protocol instead of the https:// protocol
    -   Some (modern JavaScript or Browser) features will not work there
    -   The final, deployed app will be served via https:// not via file:
        ⇒ We need a development web server

## Why We Want A Better Developer Experience

-   Current State
    -   We always need to reload the page whenever we make any change
    -   IDE auto-completion is highly limited
    -   We work in just on file OR we need to handle multiple files with multiple `<script src="...">` improts
-   Wanted State
    -   Saved changes should be auto-detected and page should reload/update
    -   IDE should provide better auto-completion and hints
    -   We should be able to split code into multiple files and export/import via ES Modules
