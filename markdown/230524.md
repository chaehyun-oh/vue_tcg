# S.6 Introducing Components

## Introducing Components

: Component method needs two things. The first is an identifier. A component is basically like a custom HTML element. You should always have component names, custom HTML tags therefor which contained a dash. The second argument you pass to component method, is a conflict object just as you pass it to `createApp()`. becuase, a Vue component is essentially just another Vue app, just an app that belongs to another app.

Before we can use it, And thatâ€™s a template since this is a new app, it needs its own template.

```jsx
app.component("friend-contact", {
	template: `
    <li>
        <h2>{{friend.name}}</h2>
        <button @click="toggleDetails()">{{detailVisible ? 'Hide' : 'Show'}} Details</button>
        <ul v-if="detailVisible">
            <li><strong>Phone:</strong> {{friend.phone}}</li>
            <li><strong>Email:</strong> {{friend.email}}</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    `,
	data() {
		return {
			detailVisible: false,
			friend: {
				id: "manuel",
				name: "Manuel Lorenz",
				phone: "01234 5678 991",
				email: "manuel@localhost.com",
			},
		};
	},
	methods: {
		toggleDetails() {
			this.detailVisible = !this.detailVisible;
		},
	},
});
```
