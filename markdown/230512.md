## Diffrent Ways of Using Vue

### Different Ways of Utilizing Vue

-   Vue can be used to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages
    -   “Widget” approach on a multipage-application. (Some) pages are still rendered on and served by a backend server
-   Vue can also be used to control the entire frontend of a web application
    -   “Single-Page-Application” (SPA) approach. Server only sends one HTML page, thereafter, Vue takes over and control the UI
