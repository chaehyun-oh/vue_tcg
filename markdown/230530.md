# S.8 Component Communication

## Component Communication

-   Components are used to build UIs by combining them
-   Components build “parent-child” relations and use “unidirectional data flows” for communication

### Props (parent ⇒ child)

-   “Props” are used to pass data from a parent to a child component
-   Props should be defined in advance, possibly in great detail (type, required etc)

### Custom Events (child ⇒ parent)

-   “Custom Events” are emitted `$emit` to trigger a method in a parent component
-   Custom events can carry data which can be used in the called method

### Provide-Inject

-   If data needs to be passed across multiple components (”pass-through”), you can use provide / inject
-   Provide data in a parent component, inject it into a child component
